# 🌟 Welcome to My Genuary 2025 Portfolio!

Genuary is a **month-long festival** celebrating the magic of creative computation and generative art. Every day in **January**, I will create coded art inspired by the **daily prompts** for this year’s edition.

This portfolio is a collection of my creative explorations, showcasing how code can transform into art. Each piece is built using **p5.js** and other creative tools.

Stay tuned for daily updates!

## 🛠 How It Works

Each sketch explores a unique generative art prompt and is created using:
- **p5.js**: A creative coding library in JavaScript.
- **Creative algorithms**: Cellular automata, recursive patterns, random walks, and more.
- **Generative techniques**: Experimenting with randomness, rules, and visual aesthetics.

---

## 🎨 Highlights

- **Interactive features**: Many sketches allow you to drag, click, or interact with the canvas.
- **Dynamic visuals**: Watch as the art evolves frame by frame.
- **Custom rules**: Inspired by generative art legends, my sketches feature a blend of structure and chaos.
