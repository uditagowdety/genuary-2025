# 🌟 welcome to my genuary 2025 portfolio!

genuary is a **month-long festival** celebrating the magic of creative computation and generative art. every day in **january**, i will create coded art inspired by the **daily prompts** for this year’s edition.

this portfolio is a collection of my creative explorations, showcasing how code can transform into art. each piece is built using **p5.js** and other creative tools.

stay tuned for daily updates!

## 🛠 how it works

each sketch explores a unique generative art prompt and is created using:
- **p5.js**: a creative coding library in javascript.
- **creative algorithms**: cellular automata, recursive patterns, random walks, and more.
- **generative techniques**: experimenting with randomness, rules, and visual aesthetics.

## 🎨 highlights

- interactive features: many sketches allow you to drag, click, or interact with the canvas.
- dynamic visuals: watch as the art evolves frame by frame.
- custom rules: inspired by generative art legends, my sketches feature a blend of structure and chaos.
